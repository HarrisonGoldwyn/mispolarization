# Notes on rereading `fit_model_fields_to_real_dip.ipynb`, containing my previous workflow fitting experimental plasmon-coupled single-molecule images


- Not sure why the extended FittingTools class adds 200 nm to the inital guesse coordinates...

- Can give Zuo the first task of looking at Images and finding plasmons in background, this could likely be automated, which could be interesting.
